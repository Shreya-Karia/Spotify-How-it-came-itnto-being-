The first graph shows term-frequency charts for various music streaming platforms. Napster was one of the earliest platforms where one can share and download music for free. Later it was shut down due to a lot of copyright lawsuits. We can see that its frequency is high in the 90â€™s when it was founded and then we can see a decline in frequency. While Spotify has a high-term frequency, apple music seems to have a consistent one. The rise of Spotify can be seen and is still rising as Spotify has become the top streaming service and is the talk of the time.
